"bad" ending: Hero uses the hammer to beat the werewolf, the werewolf says something along the lines of "You don't understand what's happening"
              When the werewolf dies, the screen instantly blacks out and the hero wakes back up at the beginning of the game.
              
Bad ending 2nd time: Same events as the first time, but when the player wakes up, a thought bubble appears over his head with the line
                        "I can save them..."

true ending: The hero knows what needs to happen in order to break the loop, drops his weapon and raises his hands. Werewolf says
              something (dialogue will be written later) Camera switches to a first-person view from the werewolf, who stabs the player in the chest.
              Camera switches back to third-person and shows the werewolf has changed into a human, who is the same as the hero. 
              The player-version of the hero collapses, the werewolf-hero fades away, and the screen blacks out.
