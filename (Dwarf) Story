Player comes to another fork in the road. If they choose Left, they meet the dwarf.

Panel 1 - Player hears the dwarf screaming as he is mining into a mountain because he found gold. Player thought he was yelling for help
          Dwarf turns around to show the player all the gold he found. Werewolf roars in the distance and a rockslide pins the dwarf down.
Panel 2 - Dwarf tells the player he set up a camp and has a stash of beer, tells the player to go get him one.
Panel 3 - Player has a flashback of drinking with the dwarf before going hunting for the werewolf. 
Panel 4 - Player goes to the Dwarfs camp, enters his tent. There are dozens of kegs of beer everywhere. 
          Choice a - stay and drink beer (drinking minigame), choice b - bring a beer back to the dwarf
Panel 5a - If the player stays and drinks, they play a short minigame where they drink as many beers as they possibly can, eventually
            passing out after a set amount of time. They wake up somewhere they don't recognize with a
            leftover glass of beer and continue on to the end of the game.
panel 5b - If the player brings a beer back to the dwarf, they arrive to find the dwarf dead before they got there. They keep the beer and
            move on.
            
Final Playthrough - When the dwarf asks the player for a beer, the player already has it. The dwarf drinks it (short version of the minigame?)
                    and gets the strength to move the boulders. The player moves on.
